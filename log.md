# Log

### June 1st, 2024

Starting this log to keep myself focused, track my progress, and to be able to reference it later. \
The format is as follows: 
- A goals section describing what I intend to get done
- A notes section for any significant unplanned changes I make or just to say everything went to plan
- An optional issues section where I describe problems I'm having
- An optional fixes section where I describe the solutions/fixes to the problems in the issues section
I wish I thought of this earlier, but it is what it is.

Goals for today:
- [x] Implement pop\_params
- [x] Implement bind\_args
- [x] Implement eval\_arguments
- [x] Ensure that eval.c compiles without any warnings
- [ ] Begin writing tests for eval.c

Notes:
- Added validate\_params function to check for duplicate parameters
    - Also added check in eval\_application to see if the right number of args was provided
