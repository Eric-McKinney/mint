# Log

### June 1st, 2024

Starting this log to keep myself focused, track my progress, and to be able to reference it later.

Goals for today:
- [ ] Implement pop\_params
- [ ] Implement eval\_arguments
- [ ] Ensure that eval.c compiles without any warnings

Notes:
- Added validate\_params function to check for duplicate parameters
